## About

Simulation software is an integral part of nowadays research. However, software engineering for simulation software has been identified as one major part of research recently. It has been acknowledged by the increasing number of research software engineers and funding agencies such as the German Research Foundation DFG.

You might also be interested in the course [TODO (SimTech)](https://TODO) by Prof. Flemisch that is starting in summer term 2022. Prof. Flemisch's course has a stronger focus on software engineering patterns and project work in C++ for simulation software. The course "Simulation Software Engineering" will focus more on the tools commonly used in the development in simulation software. The course by Prof. Flemisch is **not** a prerequisite to follow this course on simulation software engineering and you are encouraged to follow both courses if you are interested in the topic.

## Content of the course

The course is about simulation software. More precisely, we discuss the software tools used to ensure good software engineering for open-source simulation tool such as preCICE, DuMUX, FEniCS and so on. This is not a course focused on programming and programming paradigms, but on the techniques and the correspnding tools. Some examples for course contens are version control (Git, GitHub, GitLab), virtualization/containerization (Docker), Testing (GitHub, GitLab, Containers), Documentation  (Jekyll, mkdocs, sphinx).

## Target audience

This course is aimed at master-level students from Computer Science, Simulation Sciences and related fields, but is also open to PhD students or anyone else interested. We expect you to have some knowledge in software development, basic tools and programming. However, we will also give you extra information or point to additional resources if you have the feeling you need to catch up with some topic.

*An example*
We will shortly touch on [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- You are a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) expert? That is great.
- You have used Git before, but basically use the same 5 commands the same time? That is fine and a good foundation to
- You had heard about Git some time in a lecture, but you have never used it? You will be good to go with the examples in the lectures and the references presented there.

In any case would like you to tell us about your experiences with Git and how you use it.

## Resources

All teaching resources will be made available online on GitHub and this homepage.

We encourage **you** to extend these resources, fix mistakes or update the materials.

## Assignments and lab work.

There will be two types of assignments. We will have smaller lab work that will help you to get familiar with the presented software engineering tools

Parallel to the lab work you will get a bigger assignment where you work with a bigger open-source project that is focusing on simulations or some aspect of simulations. Some of these steps:

1. Get familiar with a certain open-source project related to simulations.
2. Analyze the software engineering infrastructure of this project.
3. You contribute to the project by creating a pull request.

Each of these steps incorporates the presentation of your findings and work in class.

The lab work and assignments are an important part of this course. There will be **no** written or oral exam at the end of the lecture. Instead, you will be evaluated continuously based on the lab work and assignments.
