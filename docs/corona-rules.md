Let us try to all work together to make this as smooth as possible.

* We need to check everybody's **3G status** and **registration for contact tracing**
  * Use hardware cactUS reader for both when entering the room (each session)
  * The lecture has below 35 students --> Lecturers need to check --> Please do not enter the room before the lecturers are there (15 mins before session)
  * Please act accordingly (e.g. fill out paper registration if needed or get tested if needed)
  * Check out after lecture
* Everybody in audience needs to wear an **FFP2 mask**
* Keep distance, but please do not spread equally over the large room
